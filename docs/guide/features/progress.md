## Volume Statistics

### Total Volume

Track your training volume:

- Weekly volume (sets × reps × weight)
- Monthly volume
- Volume by muscle group
- Volume by exercise

### Volume Trends

Identify patterns:

- Increasing volume = progressive overload
- Decreasing volume = deload or fatigue
- Consistent volume = maintenance

### Volume Distribution

See how volume is distributed:

- **Pie chart** - Volume by muscle group
- Identify imbalances
- Adjust training accordingly

## Training Consistency

### Consistency Heatmap

Visual calendar showing:

- Days you trained (colored squares)
- Rest days (gray squares)
- Training frequency patterns
- Streaks and gaps

### Workout Frequency

Statistics on training frequency:

- Workouts per week (average)
- Longest training streak
- Most active month
- Current streak

### Training Calendar

Month view of all sessions:

- Click any day to see session details
- Visual density shows training volume
- Easy to spot patterns and gaps

## Muscle Distribution

### Muscle Group Analysis

See which muscles you're training:

- **Bar chart** - Sets per muscle group
- Identify overworked/underworked areas
- Balance your programming

### Exercise Variety

Track exercise diversity:

- Number of unique exercises
- Frequency of each exercise
- Identify if you're too focused on certain movements

## Charts and Graphs

### Weight Progression

Track strength gains:

- Exercise-specific graphs
- Weight over time
- Volume over time
- Reps at a given weight

### Body Composition

Monitor body changes:

- Weight trends
- Target weight progress
- BMI changes

## Using Progress Data

### Identify Plateaus

Look for:

- Flat lines in weight progression
- Decreasing volume without deload
- No PRs in extended period

**Solution:** Adjust programming, increase volume, or change exercise variations

### Optimize Training Frequency

Use consistency data:

- Are you training enough?
- Too much volume causing fatigue?
- Balance training and recovery

### Set Goals

Based on your data:

- **Short-term:** Beat last week's volume
- **Medium-term:** Set new PR within 4 weeks
- **Long-term:** Add 20kg to squat by year end

## Best Practices

### Regular Reviews

Check progress weekly:

- Are you progressing as planned?
- Any concerning trends?
- Time to adjust programming?

### Context Matters

Consider external factors:

- Sleep quality
- Stress levels
- Nutrition changes
- Life events

### Long-Term Focus

Don't obsess over daily/weekly fluctuations:

- Look at monthly trends
- Progress isn't always linear
- Deloads and recovery are normal
