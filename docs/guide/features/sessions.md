# Workout Sessions

Learn how to create, log, and manage your workout sessions in ASAP.

## Overview

Workout sessions are the core of ASAP. Each session represents a complete training session where you log all exercises, sets, reps, and weights used.

## Creating a Session

### Step 1: Start a New Session

1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Click **"Start Workout"** button
3. Enter a session name (e.g., "Push Day A", "Lower Power")
4. Add optional notes about the session

### Step 2: Add Exercises

1. Click **"Add Exercise"**
2. Browse or search the exercise library
3. Use filters to find exercises by muscle group
4. Click an exercise to add it to your session

You can add as many exercises as needed for your workout.

### Step 3: Log Sets

For each exercise:

1. **Enter weight used** - In kg or lbs based on your preference
2. **Enter reps completed** - Actual reps performed
3. **Add set notes** (optional) - Form cues, RPE, feeling, etc.
4. Click **"Add Set"** to log the set
5. Repeat for all working sets

#### Set Notes Examples

- "RPE 8" - Rate of perceived exertion
- "Felt easy, increase next time"
- "Form breakdown on last rep"
- "30 sec rest" - Rest time between sets

### Step 4: Complete Session

1. Review all exercises and sets
2. Add any final session notes
3. Click **"Complete Workout"**
4. Your session is saved!

## Viewing Past Sessions

### History Tab

Access your workout history:

1. Go to **History** tab in bottom navigation
2. View sessions in calendar or list format
3. Click any session to see full details

### Session Details

When viewing a session, you'll see:

- Session name and date
- All exercises performed
- Sets, reps, and weights for each exercise
- Notes and comments
- Total volume and duration

## Progressive Overload

Use your session history to implement progressive overload:

### Before Your Workout

1. Open your last similar session (e.g., last "Push Day A")
2. Review the weights and reps you used
3. Plan to beat those numbers today

### During Your Workout

- Try to add weight to the bar
- Or add more reps at the same weight
- Or add more sets
- Or decrease rest time

### After Your Workout

Compare your current session to previous ones:

- Did you lift more total volume?
- Did you hit new rep PRs?
- Did you increase weight?

## Tips for Effective Session Logging

### Be Specific with Names

Good session names:

- "Push Day A" / "Push Day B" (if you alternate)
- "Upper Power" / "Upper Hypertrophy"
- "Squat Focus" / "Deadlift Focus"

Avoid generic names like "Workout" or "Gym"

### Log in Real-Time

- Log sets immediately after completing them
- Don't wait until after the workout
- Fresh data is accurate data

### Use Notes Effectively

Record valuable information:

- How you felt during the exercise
- Any form adjustments made
- Equipment variations (e.g., "used dumbbell instead of barbell")
- Environmental factors (e.g., "gym was crowded", "felt tired")

### Track Everything

Even deload weeks and bad sessions:

- Every data point is valuable
- Helps identify patterns
- Shows the full picture of your training

## Common Workflows

### Repeating a Previous Workout

1. Find your last similar session in History
2. Click **"Repeat Workout"**
3. Session is created with same exercises
4. Log your new weights and reps

### Modifying Mid-Workout

- Add exercises on the fly if needed
- Skip exercises if equipment isn't available
- Adjust weights based on how you feel

### Splitting Long Sessions

If your workout is taking too long:

1. Complete current session
2. Start a new session for remaining exercises
3. Both are logged for the same day

## Best Practices

### Consistency

Train the same muscle groups with similar exercises:

- Makes progress tracking easier
- Easier to implement progressive overload
- Better data for identifying what works

### Structure

Organize your sessions logically:

- Compound movements first (squats, bench, deadlifts)
- Isolation exercises last
- Consistent order makes tracking easier

### Progressive Overload

Aim for improvement over time, not every session:

- Weekly or monthly progress is the goal
- Some sessions will be better than others
- Focus on long-term trends

## Session Statistics

ASAP automatically calculates:

- **Total Volume** - Sets × Reps × Weight
- **Total Sets** - Number of working sets
- **Total Exercises** - Number of different exercises
- **Average Weight** - Mean weight across all sets
- **Session Duration** - Time from start to finish

Use these metrics to track your training load over time.
