## Why ASAP?

ASAP is designed for serious lifters who want to **track, analyze, and optimize** their training. Unlike activity trackers that focus on daily movement, ASAP emphasizes **applied training data**—the metrics that actually drive strength gains.

### Built for Long-Term Progress

- **Precision Tracking**: Record exact loads, sets, and reps for every exercise
- **Historical Data**: View your complete training history and progression curves
- **Body Metrics**: Track body weight changes alongside your performance
- **Smart Insights**: Surface actionable insights from your training patterns

### Self-Hosted & Private

Your training data belongs to you. ASAP runs on your own infrastructure with complete privacy and control.
